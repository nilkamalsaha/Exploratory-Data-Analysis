# Exploratory-Data-Analysis

exploratory data analysis (EDA), which includes a variety of techniques used to better understand a dataset and discover hidden patterns & insights. 

common EDA techniques used by data scientists:

1. Exploring data: Viewing & summarizing data from multiple angles

Examples->
• Filtering
• Sorting
• Grouping

2. Visualizing data: Using charts to identify trends & patterns

Examples->
• Histograms
• Scatterplots
• Pair plots

### Note: We will discuss each technique seperate with practical examples and attached files are available. 

# Filtering

You can filter a DataFrame by passing a logical test into the loc [ ] accessor

• Apply multiple filters by using the “&” and “|” operators (AND/OR)

# Sorting

You can sort a DataFrame by using the .sort_values() method

• This sorts in ascending order by default

# Grouping

The “split-apply-combine” approach is used to group data in a DataFrame and apply calculations to each group

• You can group a DataFrame by using the .groupby() method
